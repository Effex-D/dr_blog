                        <p>I don&rsquo;t care what the reviews said. I enjoyed Dark Souls 2. That being said, I understand what the reviews complained about. The difficulty peaked relatively early, and remained fairly static right through to the end. An abudance of summons for every single boss fight gave the option to trivialize difficult encounters, which I&rsquo;m sure some players opted for. It&rsquo;s not a perfect follow up to Dark Souls. But standing alone, it&rsquo;s a good game.</p>

                        <p>I finally finished the first Witcher game now. I&rsquo;m still not sure why. Since the first Chapter the combat was ridiculously clumsy and repetitive and towards the end of Chapter 5 I was thinking &lsquo;Please god let this end already.&rsquo; The epilogue kind of pulled it back for me though.</p>
<p>But really, who designed that combat system? I have the Enhanced Edition and it felt like it needed some major improvements. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it was like before the massive overhaul. I also couldn&rsquo;t stand the villains and their methods. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll taunt you, get beaten quickly and easily and then teleport away. Repeatedly, for the duration of the entire game.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t get how a hero falls for that more than one time. You put a knife through their leg, watch them try to run away then.</p>

1: Okay, I get that this game is supposed to be hard, but this is absurd. I cleared the Asylum with little problem, but now I&#39;m getting absolutely butchered by those skeletons in the graveyard. This is completely imbalanced.
2: It seems I was trying to go the wrong way. The path through Undead Burg is easier.
3: Okay this game is awesome.
4: Okay this Capra Demon is bullshit.
5: I put a shield on and killed the dogs, now the Capra demon is dead. Like my spirit.
6: Okay fuck these sludge tunnels and every curse-vomiting lizard in them.
7: Wait there&#39;s a back door?
8: Okay the back door is much easier.
9: Heh, spiderbewbs.
10: Okay fuck this spiderlady and her lava.
11: Heh, mute spiderbewbs.
12: This game is making me angry, why am I still playing?
13: Seriously, I&#39;ve died 800 times and have been playing for 11 hours straight.
14: I should be writing a Bachelor&#39;s Thesis.
15: Sen&#39;s Fortress axes are assholes.
16: ... damn Anor Londo is pretty
17: Anor Londo is fucking awful. Who put this rafters section in the game and why weren&#39;t they fired?
18: or killed?
19: Okay I cleared the rafters, activated the lift and got SNIPED BY AN ARCHER FIRING MISSILES.
20: Bonfire. Friend?
21: Ornstein as Smough are the most unbalanced thing in this game so far.
22: Seriously this is bullshit. What were the developers smoking?
23: Oh good, when I kill one of them, the other gets all their health back and goes Super Saiyan.
24: Fucking fuck.
25: Introduce that giant hammer into your own rectum.
26: Okay I killed them. Fuck both of these enemies. I hope their faces melt.
27: Amazing Chest Ahead.
28: Did that painting just attack me?! I can&#39;t even look at a painting in this fucking game.
29: Oh this is a pretty zone. It reminds me of Finland.
30: Just got stabbed. Still reminds me of Finland.
31: The boss didn&#39;t attack me and asked me to leave her in peace. Still very much reminds me of Finland.
32: Well, Ceaseless Discharge died quickly.
33: What is this Bed of Chaos bullshittery.
34: I spent more time running to that boss than I spent fighting it.
35: Pinwheel died immediately. Why am I suspicious?
36: Ah, Gravelord Nito, that&#39;s why.
37: You wouldn&#39;t even be difficult without your constantly reviving adds, you dead fuck.
38: ... okay maybe you would.
39: Hah, now you died. Dead fuck.
40: PUPPY!
41: Don&#39;t make me kill the puppy.
42: =(
43: If they&#39;re called 4 kings, why did I kill 5 of them?
44: Seath the assless.
45: Seriously where are his legs?
46: Where did all my health go?
47: Time for the final boss!
48: Oh, he can be parried.
49: But if I don&#39;t parry, I die.
50: High risk parry win.
51: Well, that was fun. I&#39;ll try the DLC now. It can&#39;t be any harder than this.
