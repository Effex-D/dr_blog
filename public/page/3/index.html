                        <p>Cookies have bothered me for a long time. Okay perhaps not that long. For most of their existence, they sat quietly in the background and I gave them almost no thought.</p>
<p>But when I started my short stint in Digital Marketing around the dawn of GDPR, they were thrust rather unceremoniously into the spotlight. I started to become <strong>very</strong> concerned by what I saw.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-cookies">What are cookies? <a href="#what-are-cookies" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>For the completely un-initiated, cookies are basically a packet of information we receive from websites we visit, that we send back. They&rsquo;re not inherently bad. Most of them have legitimate uses. For example authentication. You don&rsquo;t want to type your password every time you log into Facebook, for whatever reason. You tick the box that says &ldquo;remember my login plx&rdquo;. Facebook does this by sending you an authentication cookie. You store that cookie, and while you retain and it is not out of date or invalid, your login is remembered. Harmless, really. (Or not, based on the countless cookie attack vectors we&rsquo;ve seen over recent years, but we&rsquo;ll talk about that another day.)</p>

<p>I ask this out of frustration. Today I noticed a [free-to-participate CTF run by Sans.org.] (<a href="https://www.sans.org/mlp/nordics-capture-the-flag/)">https://www.sans.org/mlp/nordics-capture-the-flag/)</a>. I was excited to participate, so I followed the link. To sign up for the CTF, I had to register for an account. Acceptable. Pretty normal. I went along with it.</p>

                        <p>I recently watched the Social Dilemma. I don&rsquo;t have much to say on that. Not to say it was bad, quite the opposite. Not only was it good, but it was completely correct. Go watch it.</p>
<p>No, today I&rsquo;m discussing a different situation. Facebook playing chicken with the EU. The story, in its most succinct and simplified form: Facebook makes money by gathering data. Your data. The EU created laws to protect the data of its citizens. Remember GDPR? Unsurprisingly, tech giants seem quick to disregard these, and other laws. Facebook are disregarding this law with their transfer of EU-citizen&rsquo;s data to their US locations. The EU have pointed this out and said &ldquo;stop&rdquo;. In return, Facebook are threatening to pull both their core platform and Instagram from the EU.</p>

                        <p>I don&rsquo;t like Kubernetes. There. I said it. Controversial I know. Given that huge share of news it receives, you&rsquo;d hardly know there are other container orchestration solutions out there. Personally I find myself wondering why. I don&rsquo;t think the tool is good enough to warrant such attention. But eager to improve myself, I decided to look into the why. After all, perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps I simply didn&rsquo;t understand the Kubernetes use-case.</p>
