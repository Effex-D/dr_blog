<meta name="description" content="I lost respect for someone today. Not completely. Not fully, not by a long shot. Just a small amount. I work with this man frequently. Weekly. I&rsquo;m starting to work with him more, and it&rsquo;s likely that he&rsquo;ll be the person i have the most contact with during my work.
But I lost some respect for him. And I&rsquo;m not happy about it in either direction.
He told me he had been involved in polyamory and I lost respect for him. I shouldn&rsquo;t have. This should have been an inconsequential detail about his social life that I never had to consider. But he told me. And I feel like that&rsquo;s always the way with such people. They want others to know, they want others to become involved, they want people to share in their experience." />

        <p>I lost respect for someone today. Not completely. Not fully, not by a long shot. Just a small amount. I work with this man frequently. Weekly. I&rsquo;m starting to work with him more, and it&rsquo;s likely that he&rsquo;ll be the person i have the most contact with during my work.</p>
<p>But I lost some respect for him. And I&rsquo;m not happy about it in either direction.</p>
<p>He told me he had been involved in polyamory and I lost respect for him. I shouldn&rsquo;t have. This should have been an inconsequential detail about his social life that I never had to consider. But he told me. And I feel like that&rsquo;s always the way with such people. They want others to know, they want others to become involved, they want people to share in their experience.</p>
<p>Because misery likes company.</p>
<p>No one in a polyamourous relationship is happy. They always start in the same way and end in the same way. They start with someone suggesting (or usually forcing) the non-monogamy onto another person. They then go into the standard roles of &ldquo;the person who wanted it&rdquo; and &ldquo;the person who cries themselves to sleep&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It ends when one of the people, usually the one who wanted it in the first place, develops feelings for a third party and leaves the other. Because this is what they wanted in the first place, but had to lie to themselves about it. They wanted permission to shop around while maintaining their own security. And they got it.</p>
<p>And now I have to consider whether my colleage was the person who wanted the arrangement, or the person forced into it. Was he the one who pressed the issue, or the cuckold?</p>
<p>And why am I forced to have that thought in my head?</p>
<p>On the other hand, I gained some respect for someone today. After seeing her talk at a conference several years ago, I started talking on a similar subject and decided to reach out to her. Her knowledge was brilliant, and the conversation with her was stellar.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to converse and share notes with her again in the future.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s a weird balance.</p>
<p>Loss, and gain.</p>
