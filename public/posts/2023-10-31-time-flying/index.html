Professionally has been busy too.
I keep going to conferences, I keep making presentations, and they&rsquo;re going well. If I want to turn it into a career, however, I probably need to generate more content. Maybe I should be aiming for a blog post a month." />

        <p>What happened?</p>
<p>I blinked and I seem to have missed out more than half a year.</p>
<p>In my vague defense, it has been a busy six months. I&rsquo;m not going to get into everything that&rsquo;s happened to me personally over the last 180 days.</p>
<p>Professionally has been busy too.</p>
<p>I keep going to conferences, I keep making presentations, and they&rsquo;re going well. If I want to turn it into a career, however, I probably need to generate more content. Maybe I should be aiming for a blog post a month.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like if I could journal more frequently. I don&rsquo;t know why I don&rsquo;t. Chain of consciousness is not a terrible idea.</p>
<p>Better than having one blog post in May, and this being my second post of the year. It&rsquo;s not entirely true, though. Or is it? I feel like I wrote some blogs for my company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m musing with some ideas. One is called WorldTree, and I&rsquo;ll get to that in another post.</p>
<p>The other is the idea of actually setting up branding.</p>
<p>This blog is a hidden space. It&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t really serve much purpose other than giving me an excuse to write. But what if I had a more reasonable, companion blog. Then this could retain its position as spectator-mode notepad, and the other that contains&hellip; reasonable blogs? Do I write reasonable blogs?</p>
<p>Could I commit to 1 sensible blog a month? I look at the list of what I&rsquo;ve written&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know? Maybe I could.</p>
