        <p>Today I had an idea. The idea was to write a book. A reference book of useful information for network and security engineers such as myself.</p>
<p>The original idea was to release it as a &ldquo;handbook for security&rdquo; and have sections about securing, and breaking, systems.</p>
<p>But then I had the idea to augment it.</p>
<p>What if I released such a book, but instead of being a boring affair used as a reference for 2-3 years before it became out of date, I added other parts.</p>
<p>I started thinking about Ready Player One and Anorak&rsquo;s Almanac. Useful information, coupled with other things. Thoughts, and streams of them. I started pulling together blog posts from widely flung places under this one banner. I&rsquo;ll need more. Lots more. But this is a start.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m retroactively writing some based on historical evidence, wondering if there&rsquo;s topics I should or shouldn&rsquo;t touch.</p>
<p>Can I include guides to romance?</p>
<p>Can I include references to the cities I&rsquo;ve been?</p>
<p>Should I talk about music? A big part of my life, but one I&rsquo;ve not really touched on here at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thinking this made me think about adding tabs here, for songs, so that I can pull them up as a reference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I could use AI to tag it all?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s the last idea.</p>
<p>Could I embed a ARG inside the whole thing?</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
