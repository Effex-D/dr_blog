        <p>I finally finished the first Witcher game now. I&rsquo;m still not sure why. Since the first Chapter the combat was ridiculously clumsy and repetitive and towards the end of Chapter 5 I was thinking &lsquo;Please god let this end already.&rsquo; The epilogue kind of pulled it back for me though.</p>
<p>But really, who designed that combat system? I have the Enhanced Edition and it felt like it needed some major improvements. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it was like before the massive overhaul. I also couldn&rsquo;t stand the villains and their methods. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll taunt you, get beaten quickly and easily and then teleport away. Repeatedly, for the duration of the entire game.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t get how a hero falls for that more than one time. You put a knife through their leg, watch them try to run away then.</p>
<p>The story was clumsy in places too, but overall it was the only thing that kept me coming back to finish it. God knows it wasn&rsquo;t the gameplay. I particularly liked the parts where you&rsquo;d lose a big portion of your health before your screen had properly loaded or you&rsquo;d drawn a weapon. The lack of customization didn&rsquo;t help. Sure, you had different styles but they were a requirement for different monsters rather than a choice.</p>
<p>I might pick up the Witcher 2 when I have some time to kill and it costs 10e like the first one did.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I played it for the sex. For all the fun of digital boobs. I am a god. A sad, sad god.</p>
