        <p>Today I am writing a two part blog. I will probably write and publish both blogs today, but people have short attention spans when it comes to reading (but can binge Netflix like a beast) so I am splitting it in half.</p>
<p>In the first part I want to talk about Oracle, OCM and TLS.</p>
<p>Oracle, for the few (or none) of you who don&rsquo;t know, are an American tech company who specialize in database management and the systems that connect to such data stores. In theory.</p>
<p>In actuality, they run a business model similar to that of Electronic Arts. Find promising up-and-coming developers with an exciting product. Make said developer and offer they can&rsquo;t refuse. Purchase company and product. Drain product for all value. Once product is drained, discard.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like proof, just check out the acquisitions page Just try not to fall for their marketing hype.</p>
<p>Oracle have no fire behind their development. No real interest in it, other than the min/maxing of profits. As such, Oracle technologies lag behind the latest innovations from other, similar products.</p>
<p>And I want to talk about one of those products today.</p>
<p>OCM. Oracle Content Management.</p>
<p>We all know of blogging platforms. Mortals have access to Wordpress and Medium and Blogger. One nerd even uses [Se]m[bl][en]ce. We dumb them down to blogging platforms, but what they actually represent are Content Management Systems (CMS). A way for non-tech people to manage content inside a safe system, and still publish with a specific style and branding. Huge amounts of websites are hosted using these systems, with Wordpress alone comprising 60.4% of the market share of CMS systems (and 33.5% of all websites. Literally. Of all websites, a third run Wordpress.)</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another, invisible layers. Sitecore. Pantheon. You&rsquo;re likely never to have heard of these. They are marketed to people who run companies operating in the tens to hundreds of millions. They don&rsquo;t want to be dealing with your piddly little $10/month website.</p>
<p>OCM is Oracle&rsquo;s attempt to step into this market. Though I feel that is an inaccurate statement. It was once Oracle&rsquo;s newest attempt to suck some money from the teat of a business they care precious little about.</p>
<p>OCM started life in 2007 as the product compendium. A Content Marketing Platform, basically a CMS tilted towards marketing (and what part of the internet, these days, is not?). Compendium was purchased in 2013 by Oracle, and the draining began.</p>
<p>Compendium was not a great contender to begin with, though Oracle&rsquo;s habit of halting development until legally required has made things far worse. But instead of going through all its problems here, I want to talk about one specific problem.</p>
<p>Compendium does not natively support HTTPS.</p>
<p>It offers no support for obtaining certificates. Or even uploading your own. The official documentation for OCM states that HTTPS function is provided through a reverse proxy. Which sounds fancy, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>A reverse proxy is literally another machine, that converts the upstream traffic to HTTPS.</p>
<p>You can only encrypt your traffic in OCM by using an expensive work-around that requires technical resources. On a machine that could be used to host the content, in lieu of Compendium/OCM.</p>
<p>By comparison? Wordpress, Blogger, Medium, all offer TLS encryption as standard.</p>
<p>Because the year is 2020.</p>
<p>P.S: As an ironic aside: check the link above. Oracle&rsquo;s website runs TLS, so they clearly see the value of it. Just not for other people.</p>
<p>P.P.(hurr).S: Still have an attention span? Want to keep reading? Cool. Go here</p>
