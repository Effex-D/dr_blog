        <p>For some time already I have been trying to write this blog. I find, That i have a similar problem to most people: I type slower than I think. And when it comes to typing, I&rsquo;m not Particularly slow. 100 words per minute which is not a bad speed. It&rsquo;s far above average though not the 120 words per minute which I know some people achieve. The problem, in my case, I guess is that my brain works faster than that.</p>
<p>So, quite a lot of the time, I get this feeling of being held back by the speed at which i want to create content compared to the speed with which I&rsquo;m actually create capable.</p>
<p>Not all of the time. Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t, and the words flow as I want htem to. Sometimes I&rsquo;m fine with typing but sometimes just staring at a blank page knowing, in my head, everything I want to write and then having to go with the slow delivery system of typing 100 words per minute.</p>
<p>It is frustrating. Now, there are alternative options. One of which is the idea of getting one of those kind of chording keyboards that allow you to, apparently, reach the 300 word per minute or more, which sounds useful. But it also comes with a Six months learning curve that I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m up to. I feel like the frustration of such a device would make me give up before I actually use it. Or actually used it to achieve speeds, which would Would improve my situation.</p>
<p>But then this idea came to me. That my Google Pixel phone has a reasonably good transcription option. So I&rsquo;m testing now where there are not, I can speak And haven&rsquo;t recorded and have the transcript. Basically generate And use that to form the base of the blog and then just format Correct.</p>
<p>Them, add some things. Oh, because it seems like I mean, I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m speaking faster than 100 words per minute at this point until ever really, but speech is fast and typing. So it&rsquo;ll allows me to At least keep up with the trade of thoughts. So in this spirit of a blog, I&rsquo;ve been at disobey today.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s reasonably good. I have to say that the switch away from the PCB batches that&rsquo;s kind of disappointing. I guess the early years of disobey kind of spoilt everyone towards the badge culture and Now, receiving just an RFID card at least last year. It was like, It was bamboo, it was Environmentally friendly This time.</p>
<p>It was a Generic plastic card with artwork on. So that&rsquo;s all disappointing. The lineup was great listening to your hoi. Your hoy talking about FFUF. Best disappointment on one topic, which was supposed to discuss. Laundry machines, and the data they&rsquo;re collect. But that talked about small watches instead. But generally, it&rsquo;s just seems good.</p>
<p>I like the new layouts them having a large space. They&rsquo;ve added tables back to the back of the A presentation area. So you can actually sit there with a laptop if you want again. That was. In very good actually, because It was missing from last year where they kind of changed the layout.</p>
<p>But now, the Atlanta took over even more of A core ability to us.</p>
<p>So, We&rsquo;ll see. It was interesting. I had full I&rsquo;m currently playing with the multi screen arrangement of my laptop and Being. Mmm impressed. I like being able to have multiple screens.</p>
