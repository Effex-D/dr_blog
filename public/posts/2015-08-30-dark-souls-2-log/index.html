        <p>I don&rsquo;t care what the reviews said. I enjoyed Dark Souls 2. That being said, I understand what the reviews complained about. The difficulty peaked relatively early, and remained fairly static right through to the end. An abudance of summons for every single boss fight gave the option to trivialize difficult encounters, which I&rsquo;m sure some players opted for. It&rsquo;s not a perfect follow up to Dark Souls. But standing alone, it&rsquo;s a good game.</p>
<p>I did have an advantage in one thing: I played the Scholar of the First Sin only. I imagine a lot of the problems with the original game were rectified by that point. Not to mention, Frozen Eleceum Loyce was one of the stronger sections of the game.</p>
<p>I did mow through bosses like they were not in a Dark Souls game, though. I think I killed 12 in a row without having any significant problems, several of them killed in the first attempt on my first run. That should be an oddity in a Souls game, not the standard.</p>
<p>Still, I enjoyed it. And this gives me a chance to outline my playstyle.</p>
<p>I like to make 4 characters, based off the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse. They seem suitable for this game.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
Her (Death): Magic user. Typically wields enchanted sword or scythe and big magic. High int.
War: Big armor, big sword, big ouch. Sometimes goes Faith for lightning, sometimes Pyro for flames.
Entropy (Famine/Pestilence): Some kind of more unique playstyle. In this, rapid fire bleed/poison claws.
Conquest: Soul Level 1 character, designed to get as far as possible.
</code></pre><p>I have yet to complete an SL1 run, but I&rsquo;ve given it a fair attempt. My DS1 SL1 run ended at Four Kings, with Bed of Chaos already down, Seathe and Nito to go.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start Conquest now in DS2 and see what I can do.</p>
