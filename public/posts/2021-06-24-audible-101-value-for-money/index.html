        <p>Audiobooks are a growing genre of entertainment. For those of us who used to read a lot and now find ourselves far too busy to pick up something as lavish as an actual book, they&rsquo;re simply the most efficient way to keep up a fiction adiction.</p>
<p>But the platforms are odd, often ill explained, and occasionally daunting to understand. As such, here is a short guide to your first few months on Audible, how to get started building a library, and to make the best of your first, most precious credits.</p>
<p>Firstly a small explanation for those uninitiated with Audible&rsquo;s process. Unlike Netflix or standard streaming services, you can&rsquo;t simply help yourself to anything from Audible. Instead you get access to their originals, as well as a monthly credit with which to buy (and keep for eternity&hellip;) an audiobook.</p>
<p>For people who have been a member of Audible for some time, these credits have a tendency to pile up. Occasionally, you can even buy more. But for the first month, these options are not available to you. So what should you do?</p>
<p>Firstly: A little Audible URL magic.</p>
<p>See, if you go to audible.com, you&rsquo;ll find as basic a browsing library as you can expect. It does the job, though is a little bit uninspired. A better place to go is the <a href="https://audible.com/advsr">advanced search</a> which will let you be a lot more specific.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s something more we can do. Do a blank search and your URL bar will look something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>https://www.audible.co.uk/search?keywords=&amp;title=&amp;author_author=&amp;narrator=&amp;publisher=
</code></pre><p>Find the box that says &ldquo;Sort by&rdquo; and switch it to &ldquo;Running time&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll see this in your URL bar:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>https://www.audible.co.uk/search?lots-of-random-stuff&amp;sort=runtime-asc-rank
</code></pre><p>What these are are URL parameters/arguments. They&rsquo;re used to pass information from the page you&rsquo;ve come from, to the page you&rsquo;re going. You can spot them because they start from the question mark symbol (?) and can be broken down into a list of the format key=value with &amp; as a separator. Forms use this mechanic when to post entered data to other URLs. For example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>https://www.audible.co.uk/search?keywords=&amp;title=&amp;author_author=&amp;narrator=&amp;publisher=&amp;publication_date=20230077031&amp;feature_six_browse-bin=20230028031&amp;feature_twelve_browse-bin=20229998031

Let&#39;s break this down...

? - start of the url parameters
keywords= - no keywords to search by
&amp;title= - no title to search by
&amp;author_author= - no specific author
&amp;narrator= - ... or narrator
&amp;publisher= ... or publisher
&amp;publication_date=20230077031 - published in the last 30 days
&amp;feature_six_browse-bin=20230028031 - feature value for &#34;in English&#34;, I suspect
&amp;feature_twelve_browse-bin=20229998031 - feature value for &#34;Format: Audiobook&#34;
</code></pre><p>Easy. Right. So if we go back to our search URL:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>https://www.audible.co.uk/search?lots-of-random-stuff&amp;sort=runtime-asc-rank

asc typically means &#34;Ascending&#34;. Change it to desc.

https://www.audible.co.uk/search?lots-of-random-stuff&amp;sort=runtime-desc-rank
</code></pre><p>And just like that, we get all of Audible&rsquo;s audio books in descending order of playtime. Why this option isn&rsquo;t included in the dropdown menu is not immediately obvious from a technical standpoint. But from a business standpoint it is. Each credit is worth money. As you might expect, the business side of audible wants you spending as much as possible.</p>
<p>That being said, scrolling down the list of playtime shows that you can get fairly far on limited credits. Of course, if you&rsquo;re just looking to maximize your listening time, start at the top and work your way down.</p>
<p>But a few entries down we end up at <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Ultimate-Science-Fiction-Mega-Collection-16-of-the-Best-Sci-Fi-Books-of-All-Time-Audiobook/B094X4YQK1">a scifi collection</a> that will net you 16 books, including some of the classics. Frankenstein, the Time Machine, The Invisible Man, and a large helping of Jules Verne&rsquo;s most famous works. You can do worse with your first credit than one-hundred-and-eight hours of classics.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also Sherlock Homles: The Definitive Collection, narrated by Steven Fry for just over seventy hours of entertainment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All DEAD&rdquo; deserves a nod of recognition as the longest thing of any kind to appear on Audible, though having never listened, I can&rsquo;t say much more than that.</p>
<p>10 Masterpieces You Have to Read Before You Die 1 is hell of a convoluted title, but does contain classics. Jane Austen&rsquo;s complete works, Mark Twain&rsquo;s Complete works, George Orwell,  Shakespeare. Even the bible, if you&rsquo;re that way inclined.</p>
<p>In short, aim for authors, not books. Classics, rather than modern works. Lots of their work falls into the public domain, which made it freely available for narrators and gives a great deal of choice and value. Though technically a lot of these can be found free on <a href="https://librivox.org">Librivox</a>, so keep that in mind.</p>
