        <p>In my old blog I had some mysterious and stupid post about who I was, clamouring about anonymity. It raises a good point, as I don&rsquo;t think people really need to be tracked as much as they are (and as someone who worked in Digital Marketing for a while, it is <strong>way</strong> more than you think.)</p>
<p>Here it is, in all it&rsquo;s random pretentious glory:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not clear. I&rsquo;m a random nerd. From a random country. With a random name. One of my coding projects is this. [Se]m[bl][en]ce. My secure blogging platform. It&rsquo;s ripped off from somewhere. I don&rsquo;t recall where. Some tutorial. If it was yours: Thanks. You saved me a ton of time. Its keywords are: Secure. Anonymous.</p>
<p>I am also a security researcher and enthusiast. Occasional CTF aficionado. Maybe even hacker? Whatever you want to call me.</p>
<p>This blog is for me to document my journey, and thoughts. It&rsquo;s a log of errors. And for the most part, they&rsquo;re my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s keywords are&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know what I was drinking at the time. But most of the above is true. I coded Semblence as a security example for entrapment security, making hackers get confused and give up, etc. I used it for a while.</p>
<p>I am a random nerd. That&rsquo;s true. But I&rsquo;m also not.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I do a lot of nerd things. But I also don&rsquo;t do a lot of them.</p>
<p>I like comic book movies. I don&rsquo;t like comics. It&rsquo;s weird, but I think they suffer from Soap Opera Syndrome where every issue has to one-up the last that leads to poorly written back and forth between heroes and villains.</p>
<p>I like video games. I&rsquo;m not sure I have favourites. There are some I revisit often. Joust on the Atari 7800 (not the 2600 version). Final Fantasy games. The Dark Souls series I seem to come back to at least once every 18 months. Super Metroid for the SNES. Any of the MasterSystem or MegaDrive games I grew up with. I&rsquo;ve played WoW casually for 13 years.</p>
<p>I used to read a lot of books. These days I don&rsquo;t get the time. But audiobooks are a life-saver.</p>
<p>That being said, a lot of people throughout my life never knew much of my nerdy side. I play the guitar and the piano. Have performed in a handful of pubs, bars, etc across two continents. I have a violin I intend to learn more once this Corona situation is resolved. Lots of these people never knew me as nerdy.</p>
<p>I like building things. I made a side-blast furnace to work metal, anvil constructed from an old railway track. I write music.</p>
<p>I write. It&rsquo;s a big thing for me, though almost no one knows. I&rsquo;ve always written. I wrote my first full length book when I was 17. And it fucking <strong>sucked</strong>. But maybe I&rsquo;ll write more about this later.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s Effex. Me. Named after a dragon from Bahamut Lagoon, the dark antithesis of a phoenix (because I was emo).</p>
<p>Anyway, this blog seems to work. I&rsquo;m going to kick back with some retro video games. Starting with Joust on the Atari 7800.</p>
