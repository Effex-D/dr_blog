        <p>Another underrated classic I enjoy is Moonstone, A Hard Day&rsquo;s Knight. Not just because of the punny title.</p>
<p>The Dark Souls games are ones I seem to revisit once every eighteen months or so. There&rsquo;s just something about a brutal fantasy landscape that repeatedly appeals to me. I couldn&rsquo;t tell you exactly what it is.</p>
<p>The reason I like Moonstone, is because it&rsquo;s surprisingly similar, even if it doesn&rsquo;t seem that way to begin with.</p>
<p>Moonstone starts out as a classic, turn-based, board game style affair. You take your turn, move your character as far as you want, and decide what to do. You have a number of lives, like most games back then. You&rsquo;re a knight, on a quest. You have a vague storyline. Search for keys by killing monsters across the land, then return to a place of power for a final key before heading to Stone Henge to receive your blessing and win the game. Upgrade your weapons. Armor. Find spells on scrolls. Chug healing potions. It&rsquo;s pretty standard fantasy-game style.</p>
<p>Where Moonstone breaks away is the combat. Limited by the original Amiga&rsquo;s one button joystick, it still managed to give you an array of different abilities. Press the button to ready yourself to attack, and then tilt a direction to decide <em>which</em> attack. It&rsquo;s an elegant system. The battle field allows for 3D movement (as much as was possible back then, at least.)</p>
<p>Also, the gameplay itself is not only wildly gory but utterly and brutally difficult. Even the basic enemies are a threat. And some of the more advanced ones can kill you in a single hit.</p>
<p>It is a well-made, enjoyable and very replayable game. But that&rsquo;s not all. Because I play a lot of games, and I don&rsquo;t tend to write about them here.</p>
<p>What prompted me to write this blog was another website I found, when looking up information from the game, called <a href="http://moonstonetavern.co.uk/">The Moonstone Tavern.</a></p>
<p>Visiting this website was like stepping back in time. And I mean that in the best possible way. This was the internet I grew up with. There&rsquo;s not an ad in sight. No prompt for cookies. It&rsquo;s not trying to track me at all. Why would it? It follows the traditional internet model of &ldquo;I am a repository of information. Browse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This site, originally built in 2002, is a prime example of the internet I miss. People pursuing their passions, and sharing their findings with whomsoever happens to stumble across them.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something to kill a few days over the summer holiday, you can get the game <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/moonstone_a_hard_days_knight">here</a> for a very reasonable price. And when you do, why not head over to the Moonstone Tavern to learn about the game that will spend the next several days kicking your ass.</p>
