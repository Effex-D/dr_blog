        <p>After the disappointment of the first day, I came to the table bright-eyed and bushy tailed for the second day which was much the same. Though it&rsquo;s not a particularly bad thing that the group is filled with native speakers. This is their country, and it makes sense that natives would comprise the majority of the group. It&rsquo;s just not what I was expecting.</p>
<p>When I dropped my expectations, things seemed better. The group is made of generally sensible people, myself excluded. There&rsquo;s a wide range of both security knowledge and general experience, which is certainly a more diverse group than 35 supernerds sitting in the same room.</p>
<p>There are downsides, too. The first class is about security management systems. Which I maintain professionally. I was given the option to have the course recognized as prior learning, though I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll take it. I don&rsquo;t know everything about the idea of management systems. I&rsquo;m a little concerned that it&rsquo;ll end up like my Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree, where I didn&rsquo;t learn anything, just had things I knew re-inforced.</p>
<p>But the positives outweigh it. Not only the schooling, the idea of getting a slightly higher education, but also the monthly excuse to travel. To spend a couple of nights in a city instead of my small town. To ride a train. I like trains.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fine to be a student again.</p>
<p>I better get started on my thesis.</p>
